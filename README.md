# Expressive Interaction Design using Facial Muscles as Controllers

**A novel system for controlling virtual avatars through facial muscle movements.**

## Problem Statement
Facial muscle weakness can significantly impact social interaction and quality of life. Existing rehabilitation methods often have limitations.

## Methodology
Developed a system using EMG sensors to capture facial muscle activity. This data is processed and used to control the facial expressions of a virtual avatar in a real-time environment.

## Results
The system successfully demonstrated the ability to map facial muscle movements to avatar expressions. Initial user feedback was positive, indicating potential for rehabilitation and social interaction.
